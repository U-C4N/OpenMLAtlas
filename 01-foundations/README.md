# 01 - Foundations

## Overview

This module covers the essential mathematical and programming prerequisites for machine learning. Before diving into ML algorithms, you need a solid foundation in linear algebra, calculus, probability, and Python programming. These concepts form the backbone of every machine learning model.

## Learning Path (Folder Order)

Master these topics in sequence for optimal understanding:

1. **math-basics/** - Basic mathematical concepts and notation used throughout ML
    - **Interactive App**: Includes a multilingual (EN, ES, FR, RU, TR), black-and-white web application for primary school level math practice (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division).
2. **linear-algebra/** - Vectors, matrices, eigenvalues, and matrix operations essential for data representation
3. **calculus-for-ml/** - Derivatives, gradients, and optimization concepts for understanding how models learn
4. **probability-statistics/** - Probability distributions, statistical inference, and hypothesis testing
5. **optimization/** - Gradient descent, convex optimization, and loss function minimization
6. **python-numpy-pandas/** - Python programming with NumPy for numerical computing and Pandas for data manipulation
7. **visualization-basics/** - Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn for exploratory analysis
