# 03 - Classical Algorithms

## Overview

This module covers traditional machine learning methods that remain powerful and widely used in industry. You'll learn tree-based models, support vector machines, clustering algorithms, dimensionality reduction techniques, and ensemble methods. These algorithms are interpretable, efficient, and often outperform deep learning on structured/tabular data.
