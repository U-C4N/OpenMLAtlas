# 02 - Core Machine Learning

## Overview

This module introduces the fundamental concepts and algorithms of machine learning. You'll learn the core supervised and unsupervised learning paradigms, essential algorithms like linear and logistic regression, and critical concepts like model evaluation and regularization. These concepts are the building blocks for all advanced ML techniques.

## Learning Path (Folder Order)

Follow this sequence to build a solid ML foundation:

1. **supervised-vs-unsupervised/** - Understanding the two main ML paradigms and when to use each
2. **linear-regression/** - Your first ML algorithm: predicting continuous values
3. **logistic-regression/** - Classification with probability estimation
4. **knn/** - K-Nearest Neighbors: instance-based learning algorithm
5. **naive-bayes/** - Probabilistic classification using Bayes' theorem
6. **model-evaluation/** - How to properly assess model performance
   - metrics-regression/ - MSE, RMSE, MAE, R² score
   - metrics-classification/ - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC
   - cross-validation/ - K-fold, stratified, and leave-one-out validation
7. **bias-variance/** - Understanding the bias-variance tradeoff
8. **overfitting-underfitting/** - Recognizing and diagnosing model problems
9. **regularization/** - L1 (Lasso), L2 (Ridge), and Elastic Net techniques
10. **feature-engineering/** - Creating and selecting meaningful features
